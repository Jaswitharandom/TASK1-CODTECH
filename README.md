Certainly! Below is a simple Java program that acts as a basic calculator. This program prompts the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). 
Explanation
Import the Scanner class: This allows us to read user input from the console.
Prompt the user for input: We use scanner.nextDouble() to get numeric input and scanner.nextInt() to get the user's choice of operation.
Perform the operation: A switch statement is used to determine which operation to perform based on user input.
Handle division by zero: We check if the divisor is zero before performing the division to avoid runtime errors.
Display results: The results of the operation are printed to the console.
To run this program, save it to a file named BasicCalculator.java, compile it using javac BasicCalculator.java, and run it with java BasicCalculator.
